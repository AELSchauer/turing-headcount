1) we start with a hash
{
  :enrollment => {
    :kindergarten => "./data/Kindergartners in full-day program.csv",
    :high_school_graduation => "./data/High school graduation rates.csv",
  },
  :statewide_testing => {
    :third_grade => "./data/3rd grade students scoring proficient or above on the CSAP_TCAP.csv",
    :eighth_grade => "./data/8th grade students scoring proficient or above on the CSAP_TCAP.csv",
    :math => "./data/Average proficiency on the CSAP_TCAP by race_ethnicity_ Math.csv",
    :reading => "./data/Average proficiency on the CSAP_TCAP by race_ethnicity_ Reading.csv",
    :writing => "./data/Average proficiency on the CSAP_TCAP by race_ethnicity_ Writing.csv"
  }
}

2) iterate through the hash (e.g. :enrollment ==> Enrollment/EnrollmentRepository object)

3) iterate through each data_set
	3A) grab the file
	3B) parse out the file into format:
			{ DISTRICTNAME => {:name => location, :dataset_name => (e.g. hs_graduation), :data => data} }
	3C) add parsed file hash to an array

4) iterate through the array, merging [1..-1] into [0]

5) create objects for that data schema
